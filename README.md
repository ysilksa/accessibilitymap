# accessibilitymap

### Project Description 
For a project idea, I was thinking about a web application where users can rate the accessibility of public areas. Public areas can include indoor spaces like cafes, libraries, and offices, and others can rate these places based on accessibility features, such as having ramps, working elevators, braille, etc. Location data is needed for people to identify places and leave reviews on, while user accounts are needed for users to leave comments on different places. Features might allow users to filter the locations by accessibility features, and when reporting the area, users can use chips rather than textual input. Other features like new tags, filters, and adding new locations can be added with more research (ex, ADA standards, WCAG standards, and disability-specific needs). 

### MVP Summary
An app that lets people rate the accessibility of different public areas (ex. indoor spaces, cafes, libraries, offices, etc.)

### MVP Details 
- Actors: Users looking for areas that are accessible to them in Evanston. 
- Map that you can navigate around, when clicking a location, the accessibility shows up. 
- Search for places. 
- Read others' reviews and write a review.
- Show the accessibility features via ratings or UI chips.
